  Your friend <%= senderName %> would like to enjoy a Choco-Pie Together with you.

  for the inaugural Asia Society Triennial (October 27, 2020 - June 27, 2021),
  a festival of art, ideas and innovation. To the artist, the act of eating
  Choco Pies together symbolizes compassion and humanity, a step towards global
  peace. Learn more <a href="https://eatchocopietogether.glitch.me/about">here</a>.

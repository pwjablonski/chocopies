        <p>
          As part of the Asia Society Triennial, the virtual “Eat Chocopie
          Together” art initiative seeks to further extend love, compassion, and
          humanity to promote peace on earth. Conceived in response to the
          COVID-19 pandemic, the project offers virtual Chocopies to be shared
          digitally by anyone, to send to a friend as a warm greeting in this time
          of social distancing, symbolizing a gesture towards friendship.
          Furthermore, each "share" raises funds for
          <a

            >The Korean American Community Foundation’s COVID-19 Action Fund</a
          >, a charity set up to aid the Korean-American community affected by
          the pandemic and to support the important work to address growing anti-Asian racism in our community.

          Here’s how it Works Step-by-Step:
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u>Step 1: Open The Zoomed Map</u>
            <img class="howto-img" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/1fa742a9-ec9d-49fb-8d8b-1aaa0efe3e2c%2FEat-Chocopie-Together-Mina-Cheon-EAT.png?v=1593119005599">
            The homepage displays a map of the Korean peninsula, <strong>click anywhere on the map to open a zoomed map.</strong>            
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Step 2: Select A Chocopie to Start</u>
            <img class="howto-img" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/1fa742a9-ec9d-49fb-8d8b-1aaa0efe3e2c%2FEat-Chocopie-Together-Mina-Cheon-EAT.png?v=1593119005599">
            Drag around to explore the zoomed-in map! There are five unique Chocopie designs available to share: LOVE, PEACE, SHARE, EAT, UNITE.
            <strong>Click on any Chocopie to activate the sharing process.</strong>

          </li>
          <li> 
            <u>Step 3: Enter Your Information</u>
            <img class="howto-img" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/1fa742a9-ec9d-49fb-8d8b-1aaa0efe3e2c%2FEat-Chocopie-Together-Mina-Cheon-EAT.png?v=1593119005599">
            Enter the Sender’s name, and email address, followed by the
            Recipient’s name and email address you would be sending the Chocopie to. You may add a personal message.
            <strong>Click Send when ready.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Step 4: Check Email</u>
            <img class="howto-img" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/1fa742a9-ec9d-49fb-8d8b-1aaa0efe3e2c%2FEat-Chocopie-Together-Mina-Cheon-EAT.png?v=1593119005599">
            Congrats! The Chocopie is virtually shared! Your recipient friend will receive the Chocopie in an email sent to the account you have specified. <strong>Your friend has the option in the mail to click to “eat” the virtual Chocopie,</strong
            > thus closing the loop in a wonderful reciprocal gesture. Both Sender’s and Recipient’s names are acknowledged on the map at the location of your shared Chocopie.

          US$5,000 has already been generously pledged by [XXXXX]. The project
          comes to an end when the target of all 5,000 Chocopies are "eaten together" and
          the pledged target of US$5,000 is raised, or by June 27, 2021 where
          the amount raised by that date will be donated to charity.

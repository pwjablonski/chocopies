        <p>
          As part of the Asia Society Triennial, the virtual “Eat Chocopie
          Together” art initiative seeks to further extend love, compassion, and
          humanity to promote peace on earth. Conceived in response to the
          COVID-19 pandemic, the project offers virtual Chocopies to be shared
          digitally by anyone, to send to a friend as a warm greeting in this time
          of social distancing, symbolizing a gesture towards friendship.
          Furthermore, each "share" raises funds for
          <a

            >The Korean American Community Foundation’s COVID-19 Action Fund</a
          >, a charity set up to aid the Korean-American community affected by
          the pandemic and to support the important work to address growing anti-Asian racism in our community.

        <h2>
          Here’s how it Works Step-by-Step:
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The homepage displays a map of the Korean peninsula, and a tally of
            Chocopies shared to date.
            <strong
              >Click anywhere on the map to activate a Zoomed-in map.</strong
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            The Zoomed-in map is made of individual Chocopies of five different
            design available to be shared: LOVE, PEACE, SHARE, EAT, UNITE.
            Previously shared Chocopies are replaced with the sharer’s name.
            <strong>Click and drag around to see more of the map.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Click on any Chocopie to activate the sharing process.</strong
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Enter the Sender’s name, and email address, followed by the
            Recipient’s name and email address you would be sending the Chocopie to. You may add a personal message.
            <strong>Hit Send when ready.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            If everything checks out, the Chocopie will be virtually shared!
            Your recipient friend will receive it in the form of an email in the
            inbox you have specified.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >The recipient friend has the option to click to “eat” the virtual
              Chocopie,</strong
            >
            a symbolic gesture to reciprocate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Both Sender’s and Recipient’s names are acknowledged on the "united" Korean
            Chocopies Map.
          </li>
        </ul>

          COVID-19 Action Fund By participating in “Eat Chocopie Together,” you
          are helping to raise funds towards the Korean American Community
          Foundation’s COVID-19 Action Fund in support of non-profit communities

        <strong>One complete share raises a total of US$2, when:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong
              >One Chocopie is shared with one friend = US$1 raised in sender’s

          <li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          US$5,000 has already been generously pledged by [XXXXX]. The project
          comes to an end when the target of all 5,000 Chocopies are "eaten together" and
          the pledged target of US$5,000 is raised, or by June 27, 2021 where
          the amount raised by that date will be donated to charity.

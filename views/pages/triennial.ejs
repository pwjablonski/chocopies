          The inaugural
          <a href="https://asiasociety.org/triennial" target="_blank"
            >Asia Society Triennial</a
          >, a festival of art, ideas, and innovation, is slated to run October
          27, 2020 through June 27, 2021. This first edition of the Asia Society
          Triennial, titled <em>We Do Not Dream Alone</em>, will be composed of
          a multi-venue exhibition, interdisciplinary panels, forums, and
          performances.

          The first initiative of its kind in the United States, the Asia
          Society Triennial reflects the diversity of contemporary art from Asia
          and the diaspora. It will celebrate the rich tapestry of Asian
          cultures that comprise a significant, yet historically underserved,
          demographic within New York City. The Triennial will take place at
          venues throughout New York City, including Asia Society, David Geffen
          Hall at Lincoln Center, the Park Avenue Malls at East 70th Street, and
          Times Square Arts. Collateral events will be hosted by institutions
          including the New-York Historical Society. With programs and
          exhibitions at multiple venues, the Triennial will be widely
          accessible for broad audiences while the unique identity and layered
          history of each site provide an ideal foundation from which featured
          artists will create site-specific commissioned projects.

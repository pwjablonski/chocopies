  "Eat Chocopie Together" is an art initiative by Korean artist <a href="http://www.minacheon.com/" style="font-weight:bold;">Mina Cheon</a>
  for the inaugural <a href="http://asiasociety.org/triennial" style="font-weight:bold;">Asia Society Triennial</a> (October 27, 2020 - June 27, 2021),
  a festival of art, ideas and innovation. The act of eating
  Chocopies together symbolizes a step towards global
  peace and supports the important work to address growing anti-Asian racism in our community. <a href="https://www.eatchocopietogether.com/about" style="font-weight:bold;">Learn more here</a>.

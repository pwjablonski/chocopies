  Hello <%= recipientName %>,
</p>
<p>
  Your friend <%= senderName %> would like to eat a virtual Chocopie together with you, for global peace. "Eat Chocopie Together" is an art initiative by Korean artist <a href="http://www.minacheon.com/" style="font-weight:bold;">Mina Cheon</a>
  for the <a href="http://asiasociety.org/triennial" style="font-weight:bold;">Asia Society Triennial</a>,
  a festival of art, ideas and innovation. The act of eating Chocopies together symbolizes a step towards global
  peace and supports the important work to address growing the anti-Asian racism in our community. <a href="https://www.eatchocopietogether.com/about" style="font-weight:bold;">Learn more.</a>
